# Project plan

## Language evaluation

My language will have accomplished its functional goals if it can graph 90% or
more of the required graphs for Math 30, including all of the piece-wise 
functions. I will test this by writing programs for the graphs from my homework
from Calculus.

My language will have accomplished its style goals if a user without experience
with the language can easily (by their second try) produce a proper program
when given an example program.
