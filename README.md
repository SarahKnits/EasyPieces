Information about the CS111 Grapher project by Sarah Gilkinson can be found
here.

This will be kept up-to-date with implementation plan, work completed, and 
any additional resources.

The notebook recording progress on this project can be found [here](https://github.com/SarahKnits/project-notebook).

See the 
[project requirements](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/teaching/cs111_fa14/project.html) 
for instructions on setting up your project.

### Introduction

This project is designed to make piecewise graphing easy and intuitive. By
using a syntax as close as possible to that shown in mathematics textbooks,
PiecewiseGrapher quickly produces graphs with a variety of output options.

### Tutorial

To use this program, make sure you have downloaded GNUplot. You will also need
to download the source code for PiecewiseGrapher.
