Critique for December 9th:

So in terms of usability a GUI for this language would be awesome! That said, making a GUI isn't that fun, 
so I completely get if you wouldnt want to make it for this class. I think you could get a lot of the usability
increases a GUI would give you just by changing the way the program works a little bit. If the images were
created in the same directory the original code was run that would be really helpful. It would be even better
if you could pass a path to the graphing code, and the graphing code would create the image in the same directory. 

I think a more thorough stepsize calculator could be good, but it's only going to be necessary for
weird functions that go to infinity. I don't remember weather or not there are a lot of functions like
that in Math 40 (or whichever class you're targeting), but if there are that could be a priority. 

I think that graphing over the entire domain is probably overkill. It's hard for me to imagine 
a situation where you would want to graph something - but not know the domain you really 
care about graphing over. 

I'm not sure what you're targeting with more fine grained graph output but that sounds like 
a good feature to me :). Correctness checking for limits also seems valuable, but I'm curious where
this would come into play. Would you have the compiler check the limits? What would you be checking 
for exactly? 

To be honest I think that you could probably leave correctess checking for limits out and leave 
it to the user to figure that out.
