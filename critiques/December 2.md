Everything looks awesome, the main things that I would want at this point as a core math student would be

1. Ability to control where the image ends up
2. Ability to dictate the color of sections of the function
3. Ability to specify the order in which piecewise functions appear
4. Error Messages

Other than that I have no real complaints, and these are mostly just feature requests which is awesome
because it means you've finished the meat of your project.

That said, the error messages need work. I played around with changing things to make files not compile
and the messages I got from the parser were pretty unhelpful (a lot of stuff abour missing ")" character when
I wrote illegal syntax). I think that just having some basic error messages (The code didn't compile because 
something went wrong on line X) would be incredibly helpful. To be honest the syntax is easy enough that just
a line number would be enough to make debugging easy in most cases. 

You also mentioned a few things in class that should either be fixed or have error messages (for example 
the parser choking on spaces), but that should also be fairly straightforward. Personally, I don't like the 
fact that the syntax requires an open parenthases without a closing one but if your non-CS user testers 
didn't mind keep it the way it is.
